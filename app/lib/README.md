/app/lib
========

This directory is used for python libraries.

This directory is searched first when looking for a package, and
"lib/dist[.zip]" is searched in sequence.

This directory is not changed by the build tool. 
It is a safe place for custom libraries or to override packages from the "lib/dist[.zip]".
